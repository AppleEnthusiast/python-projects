Hello Peter,

I hope you are doing well. This is just a quick reminder about our upcoming meeting scheduled for next Friday afternoon. 
Please make sure to bring the project report and any additional notes you want to discuss.

If you have any questions before then, feel free to send me a message at projectteam@example.com. 
I will be checking my inbox regularly and will get back to you as soon as possible.

Best regards,
Your colleague
